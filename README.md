- Add Items to your Fridge or Shopping List:

Users are able to add items to a central shopping list that will be their main source of truth for which items to buy for a particular refridgerator. If you've already bought an item, you can simply check it off your shopping list for the item to go directly to the designated refridgerator or you can add items directly from your fridge.

- Add Food Item:

Users can add specifications for each food item, including which fridge the item should belong to upon purchase, the item's expiration date, the quantity of the item, and it's category.

- Search:

Users can search through an extensive database of food items by using our custom search feature. If an item is found, the category will be prefilled! Users are also able to add custom items for leftovers, or specialty items. 

- Today:

Users can get an overview of what's in the fridge by selecting the 'Today' button. They will be able to see if any items are expiring urgently and must be eaten soon!

- Calendar:

Users are also able to see a month-overview of their fridge. By selecting the date, users can see which items are soon to be expiring.

## Coming Soon

- Notifications:

Items expiring soon? Too lazy to check the calendar? Users will soon be notified if a friend has invited them to a fridge, if you items are expiring, or if your friend decided to leave your refridgerator.
